    <p>There are all kinds of tasty add-ins to risotto, and mushrooms are just one of them. Mushrooms add an earthy, 
        savory flavor to risotto that makes it a good complement to main dishes like roast chicken, pork, or beef. 
        You can serve 
        mushroom risotto as a side dish, a main dish, or a starter to a multi-course Italian menu.</p>
